The motive was never to get AA, but learn new things. Having taken most of the theorotical courses during my MTech program, this course was a very good opportunity for me to learn extensive coding, get to know what happens in industry, and gather some basic knowledge related to cloud/distributed computing.

The course tought me that tackling real life problems is far different from tackling them in theory. Though I am yet to learn a lot in distributed systems, the course exposed me to many of the basic concepts, classic algorithms and some programming approaches.

Apart from above mentioned things, the course changed many of my programming styles. I had a dead github account before joining the course and I never thought of using it. But now, at the end of this course, I have become a big fan of github and will continue to make extensive use of the same. Similar to github account my stackoverflow account was also a dead thing. But now, I am a regular stackoverflow user, who not just asks the questions but also answers to question whenever possible.
